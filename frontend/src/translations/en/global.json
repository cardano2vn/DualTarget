The protocol is backed by 400-800% overcollateralization and is guaranteed by its reserve coin, SHEN. The stability of DJED is based on overcollateralization, which eliminates the need for trust in a governance token as seen in algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is also fully decentralized and community-driven, allowing for open-source development and community involvement in minting and burning DJED and SHEN. </p> <p className={cx(\"faq-paragraph\")}><Image className={cx(\"faq-image\")} style={{ objectFit: \"contain\" }} src={images.eternl} alt=\"\"/></p>",
